# DiscordExample
Also known as "GoogieBot"

This bot is a nice starting point for a Discord.Net bot, setting up a basic module with a couple simple commands.
It has console output already set up, as well as command error responses.

Have something you'd like to add to it? Send a PR and I'll add it in.
